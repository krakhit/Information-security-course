#this is an example of a time attack Hackxercise part of information security course. 
#  Q1: The function check_password(password) is used by a safe with 4-digits passwords, and is susceptible to timing attacks.
#More specifically, it takes it around 0.1 seconds to check one digit â€“ so brute-forcing all the possible combinations will take more than an hour.
#Can you implement a way to crack its password in less than a minute?
